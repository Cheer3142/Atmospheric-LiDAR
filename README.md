# Atmospheric-LiDAR of NARIT

Atmospheric LiDAR is a project designed for the analysis and processing of data collected from Mie Lidar systems.

Mie Lidar is a type of Light Detection and Ranging (Lidar) system that uses lasers to measure properties of the atmosphere, specifically focusing on aerosol particles. These particles can affect air quality, climate, and visibility. By analyzing the backscattered light from laser pulses, Mie Lidar provides valuable data on the distribution, composition, and optical properties of aerosols in the atmosphere.

Atmospheric-LiDAR aims to provide researchers and scientists with the tools to effectively extract meaningful information from their Mie Lidar data. This can include:

Retrieving aerosol concentration profiles
Analyzing the size distribution of aerosols
Characterizing the optical properties of aerosols
Visualizing aerosol data in various formats
By simplifying and streamlining the data processing workflow, Atmos-LiDAR can help researchers gain deeper insights into atmospheric phenomena and their impact on our environment.
